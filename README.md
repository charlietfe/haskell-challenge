# Haskell 30 Days Challenge

## Objective

During 30 days I'll take a challenge of learning Haskell and focusing on anything else. In order to reach the goal and force me to do it, I'm going to write each day what I've learned that day.

## Disclaimer

I know the basics concepts of the language such us, data types, type classes, currying, lazy loading, high order functions, basic functional programming patterns and so on. But I need some deeper knowledge to get the whole thing and be productive as soon as possible with projects at [Theam](https://github.com/theam). So probably my journey could not be follow as a tutorial for learning Haskell.

## Material used to learn

I'm using [Get Programming in Haskell by Will Kurt](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Programming-Haskell-Will-Kurt) because is fairly new and is a short book if you compare with other Haskell books out there. Apart from that every unit finish with a nice capstone project to practice the concepts.

*Note:* I will update the materials if I found something interesting along the way.
